# Mon Commands

## Restore Quorum

Mon quorum is critical to the Ceph cluster. If majority of mons are not in quorum,
the cluster will be down. If the majority of mons are also lost permanently,
the quorum will need to be restore to a remaining good mon in order to bring
the Ceph cluster up again.

To restore the quorum in this disaster scenario:

1. Identify that mon quorum is lost. Some indications include:
   - The Rook operator log shows timeout errors and continuously fails to reconcile
   - All commands in the toolbox are unresponsive
   - Multiple mon pods are likely down
2. Identify which mon has good state.
   - Exec to a mon pod and run the following command
     - `ceph daemon mon.<name> mon_status`
     - For example, if connecting to mon.a, run: `ceph daemon mon.a mon_status`
   - If multiple mons respond, find the mon with the highest `election_epoch`
3. Start the toolbox pod if not already running
4. Run the command below to restore quorum to that good mon
5. Follow the prompts to confirm that you want to continue with each critical step of the restore
6. The final prompt will be to restart the operator, which will add new mons to restore the full quorum size

In this example, quorum is restored to mon **c**.

```bash
odf mons restore-quorum c
```

Before the restore proceeds, you will be prompted if you want to continue.
For example, here is the output in a test cluster up to the point of starting the restore.

```bash
$ odf mons restore-quorum c
mon=b, endpoint=192.168.64.168:6789
mon=c, endpoint=192.168.64.167:6789
mon=a, endpoint=192.168.64.169:6789

```

After entering `yes-really-restore`, the restore continues with output as such:
